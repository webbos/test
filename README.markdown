Getting Started
===============

Gorillas is an artillery-style iOS game, based on the old Qbasic GORILLA.BAS.

These instructions will help you get it up and running on your system and device.


Dependencies
------------

Gorillas depends only on Pearl.  Indirectly (via Pearl) it depends on things such as cocos2d-iphone.

To get all the dependencies needed to build the code, or update them at a later time, a script was created to deal with the submodules easily.  Just navigate to the Gorillas directory from a console and enter the following command:

    ./Scripts/updateDependencies

This should check out all the git-based submodule dependencies.  Afterwards, open the Gorillas project and you should be good to go.


Trouble
-------

If you run into any trouble, feel free to get in touch with me.  I'd be awesome if you could provide me with a detailed description of the errors you encounter and the things you've already tried to fix them.  You can reach me at lhunath+removethis@lyndir.com


Good Luck!
